# Quantum-Circuit-Tetris

    The Quantum Circuit Tetris game, learning quantum logical circuit with fun :)

----

**Quantum Circuit Tetris** is inspired by Quantum Tetris, but actually is a Block Elimination Puzzle, plus a little bit 2048 game.  
This project is for the quantum challenge 2024 from [第一届“天衍”量子计算挑战先锋赛-大众组](https://qc.zdxlz.com/learn/#/megagame/megagameDetail?id=1801135605315321857&lang=zh)
