This is a very simple CUI client for the Quantum Circuit Tetris game, but just enough for quick debugging :)  

### Quick start

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - (optional) `pip install -r requirements-optional.txt` for better circuit drawers
- run `python start.py` to start play
  - type `?` and press Enter to see the available commands!
